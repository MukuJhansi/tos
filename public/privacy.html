            <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
            <p>Zelsius does not actively collect any personal data from users. The bot only processes data required to execute commands within Discord servers.</p>
            
            <h2>2. Usage of Data</h2>
            <p>Any data processed by the bot (such as server and user command interactions) is temporary and used solely for functionality. No data is stored or shared with third parties.</p>
            
            <h2>3. Security</h2>
            <p>While Zelsius is designed with security in mind, users should be aware that no data transmission is completely secure. By using the bot, you acknowledge this risk.</p>
            
            <h2>4. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page, and your continued use of Zelsius after such changes constitutes your agreement to the new terms.</p>
